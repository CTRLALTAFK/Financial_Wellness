      " Analytics and AI: IBM's long-standing leadership in managing and extracting insights from data starts with a portfolio of analytics and\n",
      "database offerings. A few years ago, IBM brought AI into the mainstream with the Watson platform, which to date has been the foundation of many Enterprise AI implementations in production. Recently,\n",
      "IBM augmented its Watson platform with a set of AI tools that enable clients to trace the origins of the data their AI models use, explain what is behind their recommendations and ensure that bias has\n",

      "enterpriseswith leadership in both security software and services. Security is embedded inside all of IBM's products and services. For example, IBM Z offers pervasive security by building\n",
      "data encryption directly in its computing processor. In addition, IBM's Services businesses are world class in embedding security into the solutions they build and run for IBM clients.  \n",
      " Blockchain is an exciting technology that is just beginning to transform business processes. IBM's platform has been rated number one by\n",

      " Cloud: Enterprise clients are in the very early stages of the move to cloud. IBM estimates that only 20 percent of workloads have moved\n",
      "to the cloudwith work ahead for the remaining 80 percent. The first part was to move business workloads that exist as a layer over core processes. The hard part is ahead: moving\n",
      "the mission-critical systems that run banking, retail, telecom and other industries. Some of these workloads will remain in traditional IT systems, some will move to a private cloud inside the safety\n",
      "of a client's firewall, others will move to public clouds, and some will surge between all of these. Wherever a workload may reside, it will need to share its data across environments. All of this\n",
      "requires an approach that is open, highly interoperable between environments, and even interoperable between different public clouds. This is what IBM has long called hybrid cloudand this\n",
      "describes the solution for the 80 percent of the workloads that is to come. With in-depth experience across all three environments, IBM brings the strongest hybrid cloud solution to the market\n",
